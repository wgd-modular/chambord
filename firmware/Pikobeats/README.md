## piko beats

The samples are, still, prepared by the wav2header utility (windows, runs fine with wine64). The naming is a bit odd, still.

There are four sets, a, b, c, d each of which have 8 files. so it's a1-instrument ( descriptive text ). This should be improved.

a1-BD
b2-BD
c3-BD
d4-BD 

would yeild the bassdrum instruments on channel one.

A better naming would be something like
a-1
a-2
...
b-1
b-2
... etc.

This naming ordering would work fine with wav2header since the header in pikobeats just lists the samples in order, not by name.
